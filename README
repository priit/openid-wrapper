OpenidWrapper
=============

Thin OpenID Wrapper for Ruby on Rails using ruby-openid gem.

Just for note this wrapper might not be the quickest fit for you if you also need 
old way of username-password authentication.


Installation
============

NB! OPENID WRAPPER IS NOT READY, SO NO GEM INSTALL YET!
I pushed it up for people who would like to review code and give some ideas to improve this initial stuff. 


Start with:

  sudo gem install openid-wrapper

Then add it to config/environment.rb:
  
  config.gem 'openid_wrapper'


Additional Notes
================

OpenID is pushed to three different hostings:

  main repository: 
    http://gitorious.org/projects/openid-wrapper

  secondary repositories: 
    http://rubyforge.org/projects/openid-wrapper/ 
    http://github.com/priit/openid-wrapper/

OpenID Wrapper will generate log entry:
  
  ** openid_wrapper: initialized properly.
